Snake.py file which initializes the turtle and random libraries. the offset allows the snake to move via move_snake() function and also the collision detection
through loops.

Go_up(), go_right, go_down() and go_left() handles the movement of the snake using the user input of the arrow keys.

the turtle library handles the graphics, pen and food within the window. reset() function initializes the game and loops the game whenever the user hits the snake.
The game only ends if the user exits the program.
